# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0 through 9), each of size 28x28 pixels.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits. This README provides an overview of the project, including instructions for running the code and training the model.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is available through the Keras library and can be easily loaded using the mnist_model.h5

## Model Architecture
The model architecture used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of deep learning model commonly used for image classification tasks. The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The architecture used in this project is as follows:

Convolutional layer with 32 filters and a kernel size of (3, 3), followed by ReLU activation.
Max pooling layer with a pool size of (2, 2).
Convolutional layer with 64 filters and a kernel size of (3, 3), followed by ReLU activation.
Max pooling layer with a pool size of (2, 2).
Flatten layer to convert the output of the convolutional layers into a one-dimensional vector.
Fully connected (dense) layer with 128 units and ReLU activation.
Dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
Output layer with 10 units (one for each digit) and softmax activation.

## Training
To train the model, follow these steps:

Load the MNIST dataset using the provided code snippet.
Preprocess the images by reshaping and normalizing them.
One-hot encode the labels.
Define the CNN model architecture.
Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.
Train the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs.
Example code for training the model is provided in the main script (train_model.py).

## Evaluation
After training the model, you can evaluate its performance on the test data using the evaluate() method. This will provide metrics such as loss and accuracy on the test set.

## Results
Upon training and evaluation, the model achieves a certain accuracy on the test set, indicating its performance in recognizing handwritten digits.

## Usage
To run the code and train the model:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (keras, numpy, etc.).
Run the cameratest.py 
Optionally, modify the model architecture, hyperparameters, or other settings to experiment with different configurations.
